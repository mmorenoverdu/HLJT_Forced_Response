# Hand Laterality Judgement Task - Forced Response (HLJT-FR)

The HLJT is a behavioural paradigm aiming to assess the ability to manipulate movement imagery. If you are interested in assessing Movement Imagery ability, visit this [Task Platform Project](https://movementimageryability.github.io/) for an overview of open-source behavioural tasks.

The HLJT has been extensively used in cognitive and clinical neuroscience. The **traditional 'reaction time'** paradigm ([Cooper and Shepard 1975](https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0096-1523.1.1.48), [Parsons 1987](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0010028587900119) faces limitations to study information processing because: 1) it is subject to speed-accuracy trade-offs because two inherently related dependent variables are used on a trial-by-trial basis (reaction time and accuracy); 2) only the end-point of the processing time-course is available when analysing reaction times. Conversely, the **'forced response' paradigm** ([Haith et al. 2016](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/36/10/3007), [Hardwick et al. 2019](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-019-0725-0)) overcomes those limitations by controlling the amount of time the participant has to respond on a trial-by-trial basis, as an independent variable. In this paradigm, the evolution of accuracy throughout a range of times used to process the stimulus is analysed through speed-accuracy trade-offs.

This repository contains the materials for an **open-source (and user-friendly)** HLJT-FR for **local use**. This repository contains an updated version of the code used in **Moreno-Verd√∫ et. al 2025** ([Publication](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cortex.2025.06.002) | [Preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.03.17.643645v1.full) | [OSF](https://osf.io/z6b4d/)).

Subsequent updates in native software ([PsychoPy](https://www.psychopy.org/)) may need adjustments. As developers, we are not responsible for implementing these in every use case.

An example of the setup is shown below.

## Repository information


## Language expansion
If you want to contribute to this repository by providing a language translation, or want to run the task in your own language, expansions can be done relatively easily thanks to the implementation of **language localisations** (please read each Readme to understand how to implement these). You can also see [this demo](https://github.com/mmorenoverdu/language_localisation_local) showing how to implement a language localisation in PsychoPy with virtually no code (for local use only).

## Online use
If you are interested in running the experiment online through [Pavlovia](https://pavlovia.org/), you will need to make adjustments to the code. This includes the modification of the language settings, as language localisations as implemented locally (through Python) are not possible when working online (through JavaScript).
